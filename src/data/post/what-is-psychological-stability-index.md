Most metrics that traders use to evaluate their performance are lagging indicators. Win rate, average gain-to-loss ratio, maximum drawdown — these describe outcomes. They tell you what happened. They do not tell you why, and they do not tell you anything until after the session has ended and the damage is already recorded.

The Psychological Stability Index (PSI) is a different kind of measurement. It measures behavioral state in real time, during the session, before outcomes have crystallized.

---

## The Definition

The Psychological Stability Index is a composite score from 0 to 100 that quantifies a trader's behavioral stability at any given moment during a live trading session.

It is not a measure of profitability. It is not a measure of strategy quality. It is a measure of the degree to which the trader is executing in alignment with their own declared rules and historical behavioral norms — as evidenced by their observable actions.

A PSI of 100 means every measurable behavioral indicator is within normal parameters for that trader. A PSI of 0 represents the maximum possible deviation across all tracked dimensions simultaneously. In practice, scores below 55 are considered Critical — a threshold at which the probability of a significant behavioral failure in the near term is substantially elevated.

## Why This Measurement Matters

The central problem it addresses is a structural one.

Traders write rules when they are calm and rational. They execute those rules — or fail to — when they are under emotional pressure. The gap between the two states is where most trading losses originate. Not from bad strategy, but from the decision-making degradation that occurs when a trader is three losses into a session, down on the day, and facing another setup.

Traditional performance metrics cannot capture this gap because they record outcomes, not the psychological conditions that produced those outcomes. A trader can have a win rate of 55% and still be taking 40% of their trades in a deteriorated behavioral state — executing the same theoretical edge under materially different internal conditions.

PSI addresses this by measuring the behavioral conditions themselves, in real time, so that intervention — whether by the trader themselves or by an automated rule — can occur before a decision is made rather than after its consequences have registered.

## How PSI Is Computed

PSI is a weighted composite of seven independent behavioral signal dimensions. Each dimension tracks a distinct, documented failure pattern from behavioral finance research. They run in parallel and contribute to the composite score continuously.

### 1. Revenge Entry

Tracks the speed and sizing of entries following a loss event. Specifically, it monitors whether the trader is re-entering the market within an anomalously short interval after a loss, with an elevated position size relative to their own baseline. This behavioral signature is the computational equivalent of what is colloquially called revenge trading — acting on the emotional state created by a loss rather than on market analysis.

### 2. Stop Manipulation

Monitors whether the trader is modifying protective stops in the adverse direction during an active losing position. This includes both widening stops to avoid being stopped out and removing stops entirely. The signal is triggered when this behavior occurs with greater frequency or magnitude than the trader's own historical baseline.

### 3. Size Spike

Compares current position sizing against the trader's declared maximum and their own historical position size distribution. An abrupt upward deviation — particularly when it coincides with other elevated signals — indicates the kind of escalating commitment that precedes significant single-session drawdowns.

### 4. Hold Bias

Measures whether the trader is holding losing positions substantially longer than their own historical median hold time, or holding winning positions for substantially shorter periods. This behavioral asymmetry — cut winners early, let losers run — is one of the most reliably documented patterns in retail trading research.

### 5. Position Overstay

Similar in concept to Hold Bias but focused on a specific threshold: whether a losing position is being held beyond the trader's historical 90th percentile hold duration. This represents a structural decision to let a trade develop beyond any normal range of patience, typically driven by the unwillingness to accept the loss.

### 6. Rule Violations

Tracks adherence to the trader's declared session rules: time windows (trading outside declared market hours), instrument restrictions (trading instruments not part of the declared strategy), and session trade count limits. This dimension is straightforward in its logic — if the trader has a rule and is violating it, that is a direct behavioral signal regardless of whether the violation is profitable.

### 7. Overtrading Pace

Compares the current rate of entries to the trader's own historical entry frequency baseline. An acceleration in entry pace — more trades per unit of time than normal — is a behavioral marker for the emotional states of frustration, boredom, or compulsive recovery-seeking. The signal fires when the current pace significantly exceeds the trader's own norm, not against a fixed population average.

---

## The Role of Personal Baselines

The decision to compute PSI against personal behavioral baselines rather than population averages is deliberate and important.

What constitutes normal hold time for a scalper is entirely different from what is normal for a swing trader. What constitutes an elevated entry pace for a position trader would be completely ordinary for a high-frequency day trader. Using a fixed population threshold would make PSI either meaningless or misleading for traders outside the statistical center.

Meridian builds a baseline from each individual trader's own session history. The system requires an initial calibration period — typically several weeks of regular trading — before the signal thresholds become fully individualized. The more session data is recorded, the more accurately the system can distinguish between behavioral variation that is normal for that trader and behavioral variation that represents a genuine anomaly.

## PSI Is Not a Substitute for Strategy

It is worth being explicit about what PSI does not measure.

PSI is not an assessment of whether a trader's strategy has edge. A trader can maintain a PSI of 90 throughout a session and still lose money because their strategy is wrong for the current market conditions, their entries are poorly timed, or their position sizing is miscalibrated for the volatility environment.

What PSI measures is whether the behavioral execution of whatever strategy the trader has is being carried out in accordance with that strategy's own logic, at a level of psychological consistency that allows the strategy to demonstrate its actual results over time.

This is the distinction between execution quality and strategy quality — two separate dimensions of trading performance that most metrics collapse together. A trader who consistently executes their strategy with high PSI will, over enough sessions, produce an honest dataset of whether their strategy has edge. A trader whose execution varies dramatically with emotional state will never know, because the output reflects the interaction of the strategy and the psychological state, not the strategy alone.

---

## PSI Zones and Their Interpretations

Scores are grouped into three zones based on the probability distribution of behavioral failures observed across sessions:

**Stable (87–100).** All tracked dimensions are within normal parameters. The trader is executing in a way that is consistent with their own historical baseline. No specific intervention is indicated.

**Caution (55–87).** One or more dimensions are showing elevated readings, but the overall composite has not reached the threshold associated with high-probability behavioral failure. This zone functions as an early warning state — a signal that attention is warranted.

**Critical (0–55).** Multiple dimensions are significantly elevated. At this threshold, the probability that the current session will produce a significant behavioral failure — a large revenge trade, an abandoned stop, an unplanned escalation of size — is substantially elevated. Most rule-enforcement responses are calibrated to trigger at or near this threshold.

## PSI vs. Composure: Two Different Measurements

PSI is a real-time score that reflects the trader's current behavioral state. It fluctuates throughout the session as actions are taken and signals are activated or resolved.

Composure is a different metric: a session-quality score calculated at the end of the session that reflects how much time was spent in each PSI zone, weighted by psychological cost. Stable time contributes most to a high Composure score; Critical time contributes almost nothing.

A session in which PSI briefly dipped to 40 and then recovered to 80 for the remainder of the day will have a different Composure score than a session in which PSI stayed in the Caution zone for six consecutive hours. Both might end with a PSI of 75. Only the Composure score reflects the full behavioral quality of the session.

---

## Why Real-Time Measurement Matters

The response to PSI data can be automated.

When PSI crosses a defined threshold, a rule can trigger automatically — ranging from a quiet notification to a mandatory pause to a complete platform disconnect. This matters because the moments when behavioral intervention would be most useful are precisely the moments when the trader is least capable of self-regulating.

A trader who is in a Critical state has, by definition, already experienced the activation of stress responses that impair executive function. Asking that trader to look at a PSI score and choose to stop trading is asking the part of the brain that is currently impaired to govern the part of the brain that is currently driving behavior. It is not a reliable system.

Automated enforcement based on PSI removes that requirement. The rule is executed by the software, not by the trader, at exactly the moment the trader is least able to execute it themselves.
