question: "Is my trading data sent to any external server?"

No. Meridian is designed with privacy as a core principle. All trading calculations and data storage happen **entirely on your local machine**. No trading data, session information, or behavioral metrics are ever transmitted to any server.

The only outbound request Meridian makes is a license key validation against the payment provider on startup. **No fills, no session data, and no behavioral metrics ever leave your machine.**

This is one of the reasons Meridian works reliably in prop firm environments with strict firewall policies. Learn more on the [Features page](/features#privacy).
