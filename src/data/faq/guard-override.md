question: "Can I override a Guard rule mid-session?"

Yes, but it depends on how the rule was configured.

By design, Guard rules can be set with a **password-lock** to prevent in-session override. This is intentional — the purpose of Guard is to enforce a commitment made when you were not in a compromised state. An override available without friction defeats the mechanism.

If a rule is not password-locked, it can be paused or adjusted in the Guard configuration panel inside NinjaTrader at any time. If it is locked, you must enter the password you configured during setup.

Most traders who configure a password lock choose a password they will not remember under pressure — the point is to raise the cost of the override enough that it becomes a deliberate decision, not a reflexive one.
